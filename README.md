# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview
Travel and tourism offers a glimpse of the world  to individuals. Weather conditions influence travel behavior and impact overall travel experience. 
The purpose of this project is to collect, analyze and visualize weather data across cities worldwide and to provide travelers with a tool that will allow them to determine their travel destination based on weather conditions.

## Weather Database
A random set of 2,000 latitudes and longitudes were generated, and an API call was made on current weather data for the nearest corresponding cities.

The following data was retrieved from the API call:

* Latitude and longitude
* Maximum temperature
* Percent humidity
* Percent cloudiness
* Wind speed
* Current Weather Description

## Vacation Search
Based on travelerâ€™s weather preferences, travelers can identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The map showcases destinations using pop-up markers on a marker layer-map.

## Vacation Itinerary
Using the Google Directions API, a sample itinerary was created that shows the route between four cities in India.
